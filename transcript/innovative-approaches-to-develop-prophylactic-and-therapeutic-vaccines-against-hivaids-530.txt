Abstract
The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) emerged in the human population in the summer of 1981. According to the latest United Nations estimates, worldwide over 33 million people are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the prevalence rates continue to rise globally. To control the alarming spread of HIV, an urgent need exists for developing a safe and effective vaccine that prevents individuals from becoming infected or pro gressing to disease. To be effective, an HIV/AIDS vaccine should induce broad and longlasting humoral and cellular immune responses, at both mucosal and systemic level. However, the nature of protective immune responses remains largely elusive and this represents one of the major roadblocks preventing the development of an effective vaccine. Here we summarize our present understanding of the factors responsible for resistance to infection or control of progression to disease in human and monkey that may be relevant to vaccine development and briefly review recent approaches which are currently being tested in clinical trials. Finally, the rationale and the current status of novel strategies based on nonstructural HIV1 proteins, such as Tat, Nef and Rev, used alone or in combination with modified structural HIV1 Env proteins are discussed.
Introduction
Epidemiology: Main Global and Regional Trends
Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) remains one of the most serious threats not only to global health, but also to global development. According to the 2007 AIDS epidemic update by World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), approximately 33.2 million people were living with HIV in 20071 of whom 2.5 million were due to new infection among adults and children (Fig. 1). Today, SubSaharan Africa continues to pay the highest toll to the global epidemic, with 68% of new infections, 76% of the estimated 2.1 million deaths in 2007 and 90% of the 2.5 mil lion children living with HIV worldwide. Despite major methodological improvements, which have cut by 16% the former estimates, the statistics still indicate that the number of people living with AIDS increased in 2007, partly due to expanded access to therapy that reduced the number of deaths. This new analysis also shows that the pandemic actually peaked in the late 1990s and

the subsequent decline may at least in part be attributed to the efficacy of prevention campaigns. While this is certainly good news, it has important practical consequences on clinical trials, which may actually result undersized and lack statistical power. As today, longitudinal prospective stud ies appear the only way to realistically measure the incidence and will have to be included in the preparatory studies for vaccine testing.2
Rationale and Roadblocks to HIV Vaccine Development
The increasing social and economical, including therapy, costs of the pandemic make the search for a preventive and therapeutic HIV/AIDS vaccine the highest priority of the world HIV/AIDS agenda.3 Preventive vaccination is aimed at inducing protective immune responses in individuals naive to HIV, whereas therapeutic vaccination is aimed at increasing the potency and breadth of antiHIV immune responses in order to avoid or delay antiretroviral therapy use in HIV1 infected individuals.4
Despite advancements in the understanding of HIV biology and pathogenesis5 and despite over 20 years of attempts, no vaccine is available to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic.6,7 However, the vast majority of vaccines evaluated so far turned out to be safe and immunogenic, with some of them showing some level of protection in preclinical models and therefore advanced to clinical testing.8,9
The difficulty in generating an HIV vaccine capable of eradicating the infection depends on many factors. Among the most important, the high genetic variability of HIV (for a review see refs. 10,11), the peculiar properties of the envelope (Env) proteins to avoid and evade immune recogni tion and neutralization,12 the lack of identified correlates of immune protection, the complexity of implementing preclinical animal models1,13,14 and conducting efficacy clinical trials, especially in developing countries. In addition to the elusion of antibody (Ab) neutralization, HIV is able to elude cellular immune responses by multiple mechanisms, including downregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules,15 emergence of mutants escaping cytotoxic Tlymphocytes (CTLs)16 and dysregulation of cytokine production.1719
Correlates of Protection
Lessons from the Natural History of HIV1 and SIV Infection
The comprehension of mechanisms of natural resistance to HIV/AIDS may have implications for the identification of novel antiviral strategies and in particular for the development of innovative diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. It is now clear that both host and viral factors contribute to the outcome of the infection and may explain the higher or lower individual susceptibility to HIV/AIDS (Table 1). In particular, two phenomena of natural resistance to HIV1 infection or progression to disease have been described: individuals that remain uninfected despite exposure to the virus [multiply exposed uninfected (MEU) individuals, also termed exposeduninfected (EU), or highly exposed persistently seronegative (HEPS) individuals]20 and individuals that become infected but do not progress to AIDS [longterm nonprogressors (LTNPs)]. Both MEU and LTNPs offer valuable clues to elucidate immune mechanisms involved in the resistance or control of infection, respectively and might thus provide a unique resource to identify correlates of protective immunity to HIV.
MEU include HIVdiscordant couples having unprotected sex,21,22 sex workers2325 and health care workers.26,27 Homozygosis for a mutation in CCR5 gene (the 32 bp deletion, i.e., CCR5Delta32 allele) is presently considered the most relevant genetic protective factor2830 (Table 1). Further, in a cohort of MEU Kenyan sex workers HIV1 specific CTLs were found both in the blood and in the vaginal mucosa.31 Interestingly, these CTLs, which had similar specificities, recog nized epitopes distinct from those recognised by HIV infected individuals24 and may contribute to protection from infection with both cytolytic and noncytotoxic antiviral effector mechanisms.32,33 In the Nairobi cohort, HIV1 specific CD4+ Tcells produce interleukin2 (IL2) rather than interferong (IFNg) and display limited activation and cell death as compared to HIV1 infected

individuals34 (Table 1). In addition, an increased production of IFNg by natural killer (NK) cells was found in these sex workers,35 which, together with increased levels of chemokines and alpha
and betadefensins (for a review see ref. 36), indicate a substantial role for innate immunity in the
observed protection. Abs may also have an important role since in MEU HIV1specific IgA but not IgG were detected in the genital mucosae, which displayed neutralizing activity37 (Table 1).
Taken together, these data suggest that local and to a lesser extent systemic, innate and adaptive
immune responses may develop upon sexual intercourses with HIV1 infected partners, which
protect from becoming overtly infected. Intriguingly, quitting sex work resulted in diminished CTL
frequency and increased risk of infection, suggesting that longterm memory was not induced and persistent antigenic stimulation was required to maintain protective CTL responses24 or IgA.37,38
This shortterm immunity may also be consistent with allogeneic responses triggered by sexual intercourses with multiple partners, which have been shown to confer transient immunity,39,40 an observation that has led to the proposal of alloimmunization for HIV1 vaccine design.41
LTNPs are HIV1 infected people that remain clinically healthy for over 10 years with low (502,000 RNA copies/ml plasma, also defined as "controllers") to undetectable (<50 RNA copies/ ml plasma, also defined as "elite controllers") viral load and a minimal loss of CD4+ Tcells in the absence of any antiretroviral therapy.4245 Nonprogression appears to depend on multiple factors.
Some LTNPs have mutations in viral genes that influence replication and/or immune control, such as those coding for the regulatory and accessory proteins Nef, Rev, Tat, Vif, Vpr and Vpu.4652 The
LTNPs harboring viruses with mutations in nef are of special interest because of the reported efficacy of vaccination of macaques with an attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) carrying a deletion in the nef gene (SIVnef ).5355 However, followup of the wellcharacterized Sidney Blood Bank Cohort revealed progression in 3 out of the 8 individuals infected with the very same HIV.56
Of note, progression was observed also in newborns and a few adult macaques infected with the SIVnef.57 Thus, HIV1 (and SIV) carrying a mutation in nef (and longterminal repeat) are not safe and, more importantly, the immune responses induced by these attenuated viruses are not effective at efficiently controlling the infection over time. Further attenuations of the SIVnef to ameliorate their safety profile reduced the degree of protection from superinfection,58 indicating that much work needs to be done to implement this kind of vaccine.59
As many as 2530% LTNPs may have specific genetic polymorphisms in the HIV1 coreceptors
CCR5 and CCR2, as well as in the gene encoding the CCR5 ligand macrophage inflammatory protein 1a, which are associated with an impairment of viral attachment and thus infectivity60,61
(Table 1).
Certain MHC haplotypes (B57, B5801 and to a lesser extent B27) are overrepresented in LTNPs62 and, together with a lower total magnitude and breadth of HIVspecific CTL responses preferentially targeting Gag, significantly correlate with nonprogression.63 Of interest, human
leukocyte antigen (HLA)B restricted CTLs to HIV are of low avidity, express low levels of the
exhaustion marker PD1 and accounts for the vast majority of polyfunctional CTLs, confirming the relevance of polyfunctionality (especially IFNg and IL2, see below) and shedding some light on the protective role played by HLAB alleles.64 The highest frequency of these low avidity, polyfunctional CTLs was observed in B57+ individuals, which is overrepresented in LTNPs. This
is somewhat paradoxical in view of the known capability of HIV to downregulate through Nef
the expression of MHCI A and B molecules hampering therefore target recognition especially by low avidity CTLs.65 However, since B57 is also a ligand for the inhibitory NK receptor termed KIR3DL1, which has recently been shown to strongly associate with nonprogression,66 it has been
proposed that the HIVdriven MHC downregulation may relieve this inhibition, triggering NK cell activity against the virus.67 It is conceivable that, under these opposing pressures, HIV be
forced to limit the degree of MHC downregulation to avoid NK surveillance, thus explaining the
persistence of low avidity polyfunctional CTLs, which however keep in check the virus. It will be
of interest to determine whether these CTLs are overrepresented in LTNPs infected with viruses
carrying mutations in Nef that hamper MHC downregulation. Taken together, these findings and

hypotheses suggest that NK cells actively participate with CTLs to the containment of infection
and ways to stimulate this arm of the innate immunity should be considered in vaccine design.
Concerning the enhanced and qualitatively different polyfunctional activity [simultaneous production of two or more cytokines (TNFa, IL2, IFNg, MIP1b) in conjunction with mark ers of degranulation, such as CD107a expression] of HIVspecific CD8+ Tcells from LTNPs,68
the capability of these Tcells to coproduce IL2 appears the most important feature, possibly related to its ability to sustain proliferation, expanding the number of effector cells.69,70 Along
the same line, virus control has been associated with high frequencies of HIVspecific CTLs with a "nonexhausted" phenotype (HLADRHigh, CD38Low), which is consistent with retention of
polyfunctionality and a low degree of immunoactivation and a potent ex vivo cytotoxic activity against autologous infected CD4+ Tcells.71The importance of polyfunctionality is also suggested
by in vitro experiments showing that fully competent autologous monocytederived dendritic cells (MDDCs) pulsed with Gag were capable to trigger the expansion of CD8+ Tcells in LTNPs but non in progressors, whose CD8+ Tcells were unable to produce IL2.72 These data should be
carefully considered when designing therapeutic vaccine trials. In addition to the cytolytic activity, HIVspecific CD8+ Tcells have been reported to secrete unknown antiviral soluble factor(s) (for a review see ref. 73) that has been associated with nonprogression.74,75
CD4+ Tcells are pivotal for induction and maintenance of effective T and Bcell responses (for a review see ref. 76). Of interest, CD4+ Tcells from individuals that control infection are polyfunctional and secrete higher amount of cytokines (IFNg, TNFa and IL2) as compared to monofunctional cells.77These findings highlight the importance of multiparametric analysis of
HIVspecific immune responses in order to correctly identify the functional properties relevant to
protection or control of infection. However, whether these immunological features play a key role
in controlling the infection or merely reflect a preserved immune system remains to be elucidated.
To gain more insights into host genetic factors impacting control of infection, Consortia are being formed to allow analyses of large cohorts of patients.7880 Results from these studies indicate that
control of infection is strongly influenced by host genetic factors, of which only some are related
to adaptive immunity, underscoring the present need to search and identify novel immunological
mechanisms (Table 1).
Despite a broader neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) response was reported in LTNPs as compared to patients with progressive disease,81,82 no apparent role for NAbs in suppression of HIV replica tion could be demonstrated in elite controllers as well as in patients responding to HAART.83
Nevertheless, plasma from LTNPs has been recently screened with random peptide phage librar
ies in order to identify mimotopes capable of inducing relevant NAbs against conformational epitopes.84
Another valuable model to investigate correlates of protection is represented by SIV infection
in the natural host in which the virus typically does not induce AIDS despite chronic high levels
of virus replication. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the lack of disease progression in African green monkeys (AGM)85 and sooty mangabey monkeys (SM) may provide clues to the pathogenesis of immunodeficiency in HIVinfected humans.8688 Recent findings sup
port the idea that in the natural host a strong and rapid immunosuppressive response mediated by
regulatory Tcells (Tregs) abrogates immune hyperactivation, resulting in a more benign disease outcome.89,90 Since control of infection appears to occur early after infection, natural immunity
is also believed to be key, either by combating directly the virus, or by instructing an effective adaptive immune response.91 Strikingly, protection from progression may occur in these animals despite severe loss of CD4+ Tcells both in the blood and in the mucosae, indicating that CD4+
Tcell depletion per se is not sufficient to drive progression and that these species have evolved mechanisms to compensate for the Thelper loss.9294 Low levels of Tcell activation and apopto
sis, preserved lymph nodes architecture and no sign of immunodeficiency were the hallmarks of
nonprogression in these monkeys. Taken together, the findings in human and nonhuman primates
suggest that blunting of initial inflammatory response and immune hyperactivation correlate with
maintenance of polyfunctional Tcells and lack of phenotypes associated to progression (loss of

polyfunctionality and especially of IL2 production, upregulation of CD38, PD1, CTLA4, downregulation of CD107) and should therefore be the goals of vaccines aimed at containing the virus. As a corollary, immunization strategies resulting in sustained vaccine antigen load and immune hyperactivation may be detrimental. Finally, some concerns about the criteria used to define protection as control of infection. In fact, the above studies in the natural hosts as well as those in vaccinated animals95,96 question the concept that plasma viremia levels and CD4+ Tcell counts are always reliable indicators of vaccine efficacy. Extended followup of "bona fide" protected animals is therefore recommended.
What We Have Learned from Vaccination Studies
Although the correlates of protective immunity are still elusive,97,98 there is substantial evidence that preventive and therapeutic vaccine approaches elicit both humoral (broadly NAbs)99 and cellmediated (Thelper and cytotoxic) responses100 (Table 2). NAbs are believed not to play a pivotal role in early HIV1 clearance in the natural infection, since they appear when substantial destruction of the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) has already occurred and the virus has colonized virtually every tissue.101,102 Conversely, it is conceivable that the induction of a robust Ab response by vaccinating prior to exposure to the virus may protect from infection.
In order to prevent infection by a diverse range of HIV1 isolates, a vaccine must elicit Abs that are broadly neutralizing. The HIV Env glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 mediate binding and entry into target cells and are the main viral targets for NAbs. However, the domains of gp120 and gp41 which are critical to cell attachment and entry are hidden from the attacking Abs, thus enabling HIV to evade neutralization.103
Nevertheless, a few monoclonal Abs (mAbs) with broad neutralizing activity have been identi fied in HIV1 positive patient sera and well characterized (2F5, 4E10, 2G12 and b12).104106 Passive transfer of these mAbs protected neonatal macaques from subsequent challenge with SIV107 and delay viral rebound after antiviral treatment interruption in acutely and chronically infected pa tients.108 However, polyspecific reactivity with autoantigens, reported for 2F5 and 4E10, the two NAbs targeting the membrane proximal external region of gp41, suggests that their production might be regulated by tolerance mechanisms.109 This raises doubts about the feasibility and safety of inducing in healthy individuals Abs with these specificities.110
Although NAbs do not appear to contribute to the control of viremia in acute HIV1 infection, Abs to the Env can be detected at the time of reduction of plasma viremia and other effector func tions of Abs may play a role in viral clearance.111 In fact, significant reduction of setpoint viral loads and preservation of central memory CD4+ Tlymphocyte counts were observed in rhesus macaques challenged with a pathogenic SIV (SIVmac239) and passively immunized 7 days later with SIVmac239 specific NAbs, despite the rapid disappearance of the NAbs from the plasma.112 Further, recent data indicate that HIV1 infected primary cells and in particular macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), are more susceptible than cell lines to Ab effector functions, including neutralization,113 suggesting that the effectiveness of the Ab responses elicited so far by vaccination might have been underestimated. Moreover, there is evidence that immunization may induce memory Bcell responses that can last for several years and that can be boosted upon recall vaccination.114,115
Finally, antibodydependent cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) has recently been reconsidered as an important Ab effector function that may contribute to HIV control (for a review see ref. 116). ADCC is an immune mechanism in which Abs bind target cells, making them vulnerable to the attack by immune cells carrying receptors for the Fc portion of the Ab (FcR) such as NK cells, g Tcells, neutrophils and macrophages. Although ADCC against HIV and SIV has been reported since many years,117123 only recently it was shown to correlate with protection against SIV in a prime/boost AIDS vaccine approach in rhesus macaques.124 More recently, the protection afforded by passive immunization with the broadly neutralizing mAb b12 against an intravaginal challenge with the R5tropic SHIVSF162P3 was strongly diminished in monkeys immunized with a b12 variant devoid of FeR binding activity,125 underscoring the relevance of additional Ab effector functions even in the context of neutralization. This is of importance for several reasons: (i) Abs

do not need to be neutralizing, (ii) effector cells belong to native immunity and are therefore ready to go, (iii) ADCC does not attack the virus, but clears infected cells displaying viral antigens, a mechanism reminescent of Tcell immunity. However, unlike CTLs, ADCC does not distinguish infected cells from uninfected ones on which viral particles or antigens are absorbed (for example, soluble gp120 on membrane CD4). Despite this limitation, it is conceivable that a preventive vac cine inducing high titers of Abs mediating ADCC should be effective at curbing viral replication at the very beginning, tipping the balance in the virus--host dynamics in favor of the host.
Although these recent advancements have spurred new interest in the feasibility of inducing protecting Ab responses, many vaccine approaches, such as those based on DNA and viral vectors, have recently focused on the induction of cellular immune responses.6,126128 The rationale is that a cellular immune response against HIV, although unable to provide sterilizing immunity, should hopefully enable vaccines to control virus replication following infection, contain viral load, slow down progression toward disease and reduce the probability of secondary infections.129
Longlived memory virusspecific Tcell responses have been shown to be critical to the control of viral replication in many chronic infections including cytomegalovirus, EpsteinBarr virus, human papilloma virus, hepatitis C virus and also HIV (for a review see ref. 29). Despite a large body of evidence suggesting that CTLs,130,131 Thelper cells130,131 and Tregs91 play an important role in con trolling infection, direct proof is still lacking. Further, in contrast to Ab responses, Tcell responses are technically more difficult to investigate. In fact, in most vaccine studies IFNg ELISpot is used to evaluate CTLs because of its ease, robustness, reproducibility and sensitivity.132134 However, while this assay is suitable to measure vaccine immunogenicity, IFNg production by CTLs alone did not correlate with control of infection135,136 (for a review see ref. 137). Similarly, multimer staining technology has provided powerfully insights into dynamics of epitope specific CTLs and their pressure to select escape viral variants. However, this technique requires knowledge of MHC haplotypes and at present it can be applied to a limited number of specificities, making it unsuitable to monitoring of the global Tcell response.
More recent advancements in the measurement of Tcell responses demonstrated that poly functional CD4+ and CD8+ Tcell responses are a much better correlate of control of infection or survival. Prolonged (4 years) control of SHIV89.6P infection in macaques primed with DNA and boosted with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), both encoding Gag, Pol and Env of SHIV89.6P, correlated with low breadth and frequency of polyfunctional (IFNg and IL2) CD4+and CD8+ Tcells.138 The low breadth and frequency of these responses might reflect the limited antigenic stimulation due to the strong suppression of virus replication. However, it might also be due to containment of the detrimental immunoactivation observed in pathogenic HIV and SIV infections, since naturally SIVinfected sooty mangabeys, which have a high viral load but limited immune activation, develop a similar pattern of CD8+ Tcell responses.139 In a SIV model, the prolonged survival of rhesus macaques vaccinated with plasmid DNA followed by boosting with replication defective adenoviral vectors encoding SIV Gag, Pol and Env and challenged with SIVmac251 correlated with the magnitude and preservation of Gagspecific polyfunctional central memory CD4+ and CD8+ Tcells, while setpoint viral load was not predictive.96,98 In a similar study, preservation of polyfunctional CD4+ Tcells during the first two weeks of infection was a strong predictor of prolonged survival and it was associated to the rapid appearance of Abs neu tralizing the challenge virus, which may have contributed to the significant reduction of set point viral load observed in vaccinated animals.140 Intriguingly, this prolonged survival occurred despite vaccinated animals underwent a substantial, although not massive, CD4+ Tcell depletion in the gut, suggesting that CD4 loss in the gut is not invariably associated to progression, as indicated by the studies in natural hosts.92,94 Taken together these data suggest that preservation of virusspecific polyfunctional Tcells is an important predictor of control or prolonged survival. The differences observed in these studies may be due to the different vaccine strategies, which may have different correlates of protection, as well as to the virus type and dose chosen for the challenge (for a review see ref. 14). The relevance of the challenge virus is suggested by the monovalent Ad5gag vaccine developed by Merck (MRKAd5), which was shown to elicit a potent CTL response in rhesus

monkeys and protect from disease progression upon intravenous challenge with the pathogenic SHIV89.6P,141,142 but to a much lesser extent against an intrarectal challenge with SIVmac239.143 Notably, the limited protection upon SIVmac239 occurred in the presence of Tcell responses that correlated with protection in the former study.144 Thus, the recent failure (no reduced transmis sion or viral load in vaccinees without preexisting immunity to the vector) of the Phase II clinical trial based on the MRKAd5 trivalent vaccine would suggest SIV as a more rigorous challenge virus and better predictor of vaccine efficacy in human.145,146 An additional factor complicating the identification of correlates of protections is the possibility that Tcell responses effective at controlling progression in LTNPs, when induced by vaccination prior to infection may actually favour the selection of escape mutants and accelerate progression.147 Such an acceleration may also occur because of the expansion of HIVspecific CD4+ Tcells induced by vaccination, which actu ally increases the number of susceptible target cells to the incoming virus.148 Thus, despite major advancements in the field, solid correlates of protection are still lacking. The recent introduction in the HIV vaccine field of midsize Phase IIb test of concept (TOC) trials basically acknowledges this weakness and is aimed at obtaining valuable information about vaccine efficacy before moving to much larger, longer and costly Phase III efficacy trials.
General Strategies Adopted to Induce Protective Immunity
Vaccines Aimed at Inducing Neutralizing Abs: Vaccines Based on HIV1 Env Protein
Former subunit vaccine candidates were mainly focused on the use of the structural protein Env as the immunogen aimed at blocking virus adsorption to the target cells by inducing broadly NAbs.99,149 However, vaccination with the monomeric HIV Env subunit (gp120), elicited Abs that were able to neutralize labadapted but not primary virus isolates150 and homologous but not heterologous viruses in preclinical challenge models.151,152 Thus, despite numerous attempts, these approaches have failed so far in eliciting durable, crossclade NAbs needed to achieve sterilising immunity, as recently soberly confirmed by the failure of the first two Phase III clinical trials of gp120 envelope subunits, AIDSVAX B/B and AIDSVAX B/E by VaxGen, tested in over 5,000 atrisk volunteers in the United States and in Thailand, respectively.153156 The reason for this fail ure was likely related to the complex structure of Env and its high variability.157159 Further, heavy glycosylation of the gp120 molecule creates a glycan shield, protecting the protein from incom ing NAbs, a phenomenon unknown at the time of the first Env immunizations.160 In fact, Env hides its Ab binding sites under the protein loops and the heavily glycosylated sites on its surface, hampering recognition of relevant, mostly conformational, epitopes by NAbs.161163 Despite the tremendous effort and the sobering results, HIV1 Env remains a key target for new vaccine strate gies (Table 2). In the recent years much effort has been devoted to the construction of oligomeric (trimeric) forms of Env which closely mimic the structure of the native protein present on the viral envelope164,165 and have been shown to be superior at inducing Abs directed towards conformational epitopes166,167 and capable of neutralizing both Tcellline adapted (X4) and selected (R5 and X4) primary isolates of HIV1,168,169 as compared to the monomeric gp120.170 However, Env trimers are extremely unstable and several approaches have been undertaken to stabilize them. In one ap proach, the gp120gp41 cleavage site was disrupted by mutagenesis, generating an uncleaved form of gp140 (gp140UNC).171176 Some of these uncleaved forms of the Env proteins were moderately superior to monomeric gp120 for induction of NAbs in small animal models.167,177180
In another approach, an intermolecular disulfide bond between gp120 and gp41 (SOS gp140) was introduced, with an expectation to induce both neutralizing and fusionblocking Abs.181183 Priming with DNA encoding a membranebound form of the SOS gp140 protein followed by repeated immunization with the soluble trimers resulted in high titer Abs that neutralized neu tralization sensitive lab strains and, to a much lesser extent, primary heterologous HIV1 strains.184 Since the gp41gp41 interactions in SOS gp140 were too weak to maintain the protein in a trimeric configuration,183 a single residue change, I559P, within gp41 was introduced.182 This variant of

SOS gp140, designated SOSIP gp140, appear to be fully cleaved, to be predominantly trimeric and to have favourable antigenic properties.165 In a recent study, comparison of the immunogenic ity of SOSIP gp140 trimers with uncleaved gp140 trimers and monomeric gp120 using a DNA primeprotein boost immunization regimen in rabbits, indicated that SOSIP gp140 trimers were superior to gp140UNC and gp120 proteins at inducing NAbs.170,184 and SOSIP gp140 trimers with Env from other clades have been generated, which have comparable or better stability and capability to induce NAbs as compared to a prototypic strain ( JRFL, subtype B).164,185,186
In a third approach, heterologous trimerization domains at the terminus of the gp41ectodo main187,188 were introduced to stabilize the molecule and 30 aminoacids in the second hypervari able region (V2) were deleted to expose neutralizing epitopes shielded by V2.189,190 This particular variant, termed V2 Env, has been developed and tested in preclinical models including rabbits and monkeys and is currently being evaluated in a gag + env DNA/PLG primeV2 Env protein boost preventive Phase I trial.168,169,177,189191
Since critical neutralizing epitopes are displayed very transiently upon binding to CD4, an other strategy developed by Merck and by the University of Maryland192 is based on covalently linked monomeric gp120 or oligomeric gp140 to soluble CD4 or to synthetic mimetics of the CD4 receptor in order to induce the conformational changes that take place upon binding of the virus to CD4 prior to virus entry, thus revealing critical neutralizing epitopes, such as those involved in coreceptor binding. This approach was tested in macaques and shown to elicit broadly crossreactive NAbs.193 Finally, broadly NAbs are presently being exploited to select peptides from phagedisplay libraries that mimics the Env neutralizing epitopes (mimotopes) with the goal of identifying immunogens capable to elicit broadly NAbs (for a review see ref. 105).
Vaccines Aimed at Inducing Cellular Immunity: Vaccines Based on Gag, Pol or Nonstructural HIV1 Proteins: Rev, Tat and Nef
Due to the obstacles encountered in the preparation of an antiEnv vaccine providing sterilis ing immunity and the protective role of cellular immunity (see correlates of immunity section), a second generation of vaccines based on the structural protein Gag has been developed, with the concept of inducing strong and broad Thelper and CTL responses, which, would contain virus replication, thereby protecting from disease progression and reducing virus transmission to healthy individuals. In fact, Gag protein seems to be the most potent of all HIV1 antigens in eliciting CTLs, it is more conserved in its immunodominant epitopes than Env and, most importantly, the breadth of CTLs to Gag but not to other HIV proteins appears to correlate with nonprogression in a large cohort study conducted in South Africa on untreated individuals.63 Ongoing trials with the Gag antigen show promising induction of cellular immunity in primates and humans (for a review see ref. 194).
A GagPol DNA vaccine has been recently tested and resulted safe and well tolerated. However, no HIVspecific Ab responses and only lowmagnitude HIVspecific Tcell responses were de tected.195 Further, evidence from preclinical testing of a Gag/Env DNA vaccine in monkeys indicate that initial control (i.e., undetectable plasma viremia level) against challenge with the pathogenic virus SHIV89.6P was overcome over time by the appearance of escape mutants despite apparently preserved anti-viral humoral and cellular responses.196,197 Alternative strategies have been recently considered, based on the new concept of "reverse vaccinology" with the aim of blocking virus replication and disease onset by targeting nonstructural HIV regulatory genes such as Tat, Rev and Nef, which are essential for replication and infectivity.153
In particular, these proteins share desirable features for the generation of a promising vaccine since they exert key functions in the early virus life cycle, contribute importantly to infectivity and pathogenicity, induce a broad immunity and they are highly conserved in their immunogenic domains across HIV1 clades198,199 (Table 3). In fact, these proteins are produced very early after infection, Tat and Nef even before HIV integration in quiescent Tcells in which they promote cellular activation and viral replication.200 Emerging data indicate that, despite their small size, regulatory and accessory proteins are targeted by cellular immune responses very early in the course

of natural HIV1 infection and contribute importantly to the total HIV1specific CD8+ Tcell
responses, since multiple CTL epitopes have been identified in functionally important regions of these proteins.201204 Furthermore, they have immuno(dys)regulatory effects aimed at facilitating target cell recruitment and activation, further promoting HIV replication and spreading.205207 Of
note, Tat and Nef are also found extracellularly and in this form they exert effects on different cell types, including chemotactic activity for HIV target cells.208
In particular, extracellular Tat can enter both infected and uninfected cells, where it promotes
HIV replication or modulates the expression of cellular genes, respectively (for a review see ref.
209). Among others, extracellular Tat upregulates the expression of chemokine receptors and HIV coreceptors, CCR5 and CXCR4.210,211 Extracellular Tat has also important effects on im
munoregulatory functions (for a review see ref. 209) (Table 3). In particular, bioactive soluble Tat
selectively binds and enters both immature and mature DCs (iDCs and mDCs, respectively), drives iDCs maturation and activation toward a Thelper 1 (Th1) inducing phenotype,212 gains access to the MHC class I pathway of presentation,213,214 and modulates the proteasome catalytic subunit
composition, modifying the hierarchy of the CTL epitopes presented in favor of subdominant and cryptic epitopes.215,216 This latter activity might be of relevance since one way used by HIV1
to escape CTL recognition is to mutate residues in the epitope that prevent or impair processing and presentation.217,218Accordingly, in the majority of the multiply exposed uninfected sex workers
of the Nairobi cohort, CTLs recognize epitopes that are either subdominant or not recognized in infected women.24 It remains to be seen whether Tat contributes to it in the course of natural
infection, whether targeting Tat impacts on this type of immune evasion, or whether this property
of Tat may be exploited to induce broader Tcell responses by including it in HIV/AIDS vaccines
targeting other antigens. Indeed, preliminary data indicate that in mice coimmunization with
Gag and Tat induces CTL responses against 11 different Tcell epitopes, as compared to mice vaccinated with Gag alone, which only responded to 6 epitopes.219 Both cellular and humoral
Tatspecific immunity may contribute to the control of infection and/or disease progression.
Because HIVinfected cells express Tat very early after infection, vaccineinduced antiTat CTLs may eliminate infected cells and block HIV infection at an early stage.220 In fact, rapid induction
of antiTat CTLs has been reported in naïve rhesus macaques acutely infected with the pathogenic SIVmac239 molecular clone, leading to the selection of apparently less aggressive virus variants.221
Notably, antiTat CTLs were found more effective than antiGag CTLs at suppressing virus repli cation in MamuA*01 rhesus macaques.222 Of outmost importance, these data have been recently
confirmed in patients enrolled prior to seroconversion and in which a strong temporal correlation between antiTat CTLs appearance (as early as 8 days postinfection), viral load decline and CD4+ Tcells recovery was found.74
Consistent with this hypothesis, the presence of Tatspecific CTL responses correlates with nonprogression to AIDS both in SIVinfected monkeys and in HIVpositive individuals.223226
Furthermore, antiTat Abs can sequester the extracellular protein, thus preventing the extracellular
Tatdriven enhancement of infection and immune dysregulation associated with them. Strikingly,
antiTat Abs, which are found only in a minority (1520%) of HIV1 infected individuals, are almost
exclusively present during the asymptomatic phase of infection and correlate with nonprogres sion to AIDS.227231 Whether this indicates that neutralization of extracellular Tat may impact on
disease progression or is merely a reflection of an underlying effective and broad immune response
is currently under investigation. Tat is also highly conserved in its immunodominant domains, as
suggested by the observation that sera from Ugandan and South African individuals infected with nonclade B HIV1 strains crossreact with the Tat protein of an HIV1 clade B strain.198
Vaccines based on HIV1 Tat (both protein and DNA) have proven to be safe and immunogenic in mice and protective in monkeys.232236 However, these results have not been confirmed by other investigators utilizing different Tat formulations and vaccination strategies.237239 Whether these
apparently conflicting results are due to the nature of the vaccine antigen (DNA, native versus
inactivated Tat protein, vectored antigen), the monkey species, the route of the administration,

the antigen dose and schedule of immunization, the adjuvant used, or the virus challenge dose, still remains to be elucidated.240
Rev is also absolutely required for HIV replication since it facilitates the nuclear export of intron containing viral mRNAs allowing the transition from the early to the late phase of gene expression and proviruses lacking Rev do not produce virions.241 While it is presently unknown whether Rev is released extracellularly and exerts effects on neighbouring cells, Rev, like Tat and Nef, is often targeted by CTLs in HIVpositive individuals201 and is broadly conserved among different HIV1 clades in its functionally constrained and immunodominant domains at the N terminus.242 However, spontaneously occurring mutations in Rev reduce HIV1 structural gene expression to levels undetectable by CTLs and may represent a mechanism to escape immune rec ognition.205 Of importance, HIV1 Tat and Rev are the dominant viral proteins produced before Nef downregulates MHC class I molecules on the cell surface, hampering recognition of infected cells by CTLs65 (Table 3). Vaccine based on Rev and Tat has proven protective in monkeys.243 Rev alone or in association with Nef and Tat has been used for therapeutic vaccination and resulted to be safe and immunogenic in HIV1 infected individuals.244246
HIV1 Nef protein is a myristoylated, membraneassociated cytoplasmic protein abundantly expressed in the early phase of HIV1 replication and released in the extracellular milieu.247,248 Nef protein serves multiple functions and is likely to contribute to viral pathogenesis by downregulating CD4 and MHC class I on the surface of infected cells249 (Table 3). Among its biological activities, Nef mediates receptor downregulation, Tcell activation and cytoskeleton rearrangement.250,251 The Nef protein also enters Bcells and suppresses immunoglobulin classswitch contributing to the evasion of protective Tcelldependent IgG and IgA responses.252 In addition, Nef interferes with the ability of CTLs to kill infected Tcells by decreasing the surface expression of MHC class I on HIV1infected Tcells65 and favours spreading of HIV to Tcells by increasing the expression of DCSIGN on DCs, which traps infectious HIV particles253 and by promoting DC maturation.254 Further, differently from Tat, Nef induces FasL upregulation and apoptosis in bystander cells both in vitro and in vivo,255 whereas it selectively spares infected cells,256 contributing to immune evasion and pathogenesis. Finally, infection of MDDCs with a wild type but not with a nef defective HIV1 induces the release of soluble factors recruiting and activating lymphocytes, which consequently become targets for productive HIV infection.257Taken together these data strongly support the view of Nef as an important vaccine candidate alone or in association with other HIV antigens (for a review see ref. 240). Immunization with plasmid DNA or a MVA vector expressing Nef was demonstrated to be safe and immunogenic in preclinical and clinical studies.258260
Vaccines Combining Structural and Nonstructural HIV1 Gene Products
Experimental evidence on the role played by regulatory and structural HIV gene products in HIV infection and pathogenesis represents the rationale to develop new vaccination strategies based on the combination of the two classes of proteins (Table 4). These strategies range from a "minimalistic" approach in which only two antigens, one regulatory (Tat or Nef ) and one structural (V2Env) HIV protein are combined, to a "maximalistic" one, which is aimed at imitating a live attenuated vaccine and therefore combines many HIV structural and nonstructural genes. Several of these new generation vaccines are currently under evaluation in preclinical and clinical trials in the context of the European AIDS Vaccine Integrated Project (AVIP) (http://www.avipeu. org).261266 Such combined vaccines should be able to generate immune responses to both viral products, which are expressed early (regulatory proteins) or late (structural proteins) during the viral life cycle, thus maximizing immune targeting of viral infection. The criteria for an advance ment of any of these combined vaccines towards Phase II/III trials in Developing Countries are safety and the demonstration of stronger and broader immune responses against each antigen, compared to those elicited upon immunization with each antigen separately.
In particular, the combination of the regulatory HIV1 protein Tat with the structural protein V2Env, represents one of the most recently developed HIV vaccine candidates.261 Preclinical studies in mice and monkeys have shown that the Tat/V2Env vaccine is safe, immunogenic and

protects monkeys against an intrarectal challenge with SHIVSF162p4 (ref. 267 and Ensoli B, unpub lished data) or an intravenous challenge with SHIV89.6P.268 Based on these promising results, a Phase I clinical trial will start in 2008. The minimum criterium of success for Envspecific responses will be the induction of NAbs against the vaccine strain (i.e., homologous neutralization) in at least 50% of the trial participants.
The other minimalistic approach developed within the AVIP consortium is based on the combination of Nef and V2Env264 (Table 4). This vaccine is composed of the nef gene inserted into the MVA (see below) in combination with the same V2Env protein mentioned before. As for the Tat/V2Env approach, the Nef/V2Env vaccine will be administered in HIVnegative volunteers, seeking to induce mostly antiNef cellular immunity and antiEnv humoral immunity, in particular NAbs, to prevent (or reduce) virus entry and to control virus replication. As for the Tat/V2 Env vaccine, criteria for advancement of the Nef/V2 Env vaccine beyond Phase I will be proven safety and broader and more potent immune responses against the components of the combined vaccine, as compared to those obtained upon vaccination with the single antigens. Phase I trials with Nef or V2Env alone have been completed189,259 preclinical testing in macaques of the Nef/V2Env combined vaccine will be carried out in 2008 and preventive Phase I studies will follow shortly.
The multigene strategy represents another attractive vaccine approach based on the design of a cocktail of genetic immunogens (DNA constructs) encoding several viral components from various subtypes of HIV1, including structural and regulatory proteins as well as viral enzymes.266 Two multigene approaches are being evaluated in the AVIP Consortium, one containing a cocktail of seven plasmids encoding Nef, Rev, Tat, Gag, RT and Env antigens, termed HIV multigene;266 the second one, based on the genes coding for Rev, Tat, Nef, Gag, p17, p24 full length antigens, also includes over 20 Tcell epitopes from Pol, Protease and Env antigens and is therefore termed MultiHIV antigens/epitopes.265 A prophylactic Phase I trial with the HIV multigene was recently conducted in Sweden and shown to be safe and highly immunogenic. More than 90% of the 38 volunteers mounted Tcell responses (proliferative and IFNg ELISpot responses) against the vaccine antigens upon administration with a needlefree device (Biojector) of DNA encoding Env (clade A, B, C), Rev (B), Gag (p17/p24, A and B), RT (mutated, B) followed by a boost with MVA expressing Env, Gag and Pol of CRF01A_E.269 Based on these encouraging results showing that this administration strategy and the use of GMCSF as adjuvant increases the immunogenicity of a DNA prime followed by MVA boosting in human, a new preventive Phase I/II study started in 2006 in Tanzania.270 As part of the AVIP program, a therapeutic Phase III trial has recently started in UK and Sweden with the aim of comparing in individuals infected with HIV clade B the immunogenicity of the multigene vaccine based on clade B antigens with that of the clade AC multigene vaccine. Of note, both vaccines include a newly developed plasmid encoding Tat/Nef as a single fusion protein.266 The MultiHIV antigens/epitopes approach exploits a novel delivery system termed gene transport unit (GTU), a proprietary technology of FIT BIOTECH, which increases the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines thereby avoiding the need for an heterologous boosting.265 Phase I studies carried out in Finland have proven that GTUMultiHIV (B clade) is safe and immunogenic in healthy and HIV1 infected individuals and it is currently being tested in a therapeutic Phase IIa clinical trial in South Africa.265 A second generation vector, called AuxoGTU, was more recently prepared and a constructs expressing multiple antigens and epitopes from several clades (A, B, C, FGH) was made and it is going to be evaluated in a Phase I/II trial in 2008.
To address the issue of viral diversity, a novel strategy to broaden crossclade Tcell responses has been recently proposed. According to this strategy, polyvalent vaccines can be made that comprise a mosaic of several naturally occurring sequences computationally optimized to include the maximum number of potential Tcell epitopes from relatively conserved and immunologically relevant HIV1 proteins.271 In vivo testing will verify the validity of this approach.

Key Issues Relevant to HIV Vaccine Development: How to Get the
Right Responses in the Right Places
Mucosal Vaccines
Since most of the HIV1 infections are caused by mucosal transmission both horizontally (sexual intercourse) and vertically (child delivery and breastfeeding), an AIDS vaccine must primarily elicit a robust immune response at the mucosal surfaces.110 Most of the AIDS vaccine candidates that are currently in clinical trials around the world are delivered by intramuscular or intradermal injection. These routes of administration induce Ab and cellular immune responses in peripheral lymphoid tissues (systemic immunity), although evidence in human of mucosal responses upon intramuscular vaccination with a recombinant canarypox HIV1 vaccine have also been reported.272 Furthermore, studies of SIV infection in macaques indicated that, regardless of the route of infec tion, the gastrointestinal and vaginal mucosae represent the major site of virus replication and amplification and the initial sites of CD4+ Tcell depletion.273275 In particular a rapid depletion of CD4+ Tcells has been observed in the vagina of SIVinfected macaques, particularly among the CCR5+ CD4+ subset that is the preferential target for elimination by SIV infection.276
Several studies indicated that secretory IgA inhibit virus assembly and intracellular release and play an important role in inhibiting HIV transmission via the mucosal route, in multiply exposed females.277,278 Further, multiple rectal exposures to low doses of SIV induced MHC class Irestricted cytotoxic responses that protected against a mucosal challenge with an heterologous virus.279 Similarly, studies in the macaque model provided insights on the protective role of highavidity mucosal CTL responses generated upon intrarectal vaccination.280,281 Taken together these data suggest an important protective role for IgA and CTLs at the portal of virus entry. In this regard, mucosal immunisation appears to be more effective than systemic vaccination at eliciting humoral (IgA and IgG) and cellular (CD8+ CTLs) immune responses.282,283 However, not all the mucosal routes of vaccine administration are equally good at inducing immune responses at the different mucosal surfaces in the body. For instance, oral vaccines are effective at preventing infections that primarily target intestinal tissues, but are not very efficient at inducing IgA in the vagina, one of the main ports of entry of HIV1.284 A few studies have suggested that local administration of protein vaccines to the mucosa of the genitourinary tract induces a weak to modest local immunity at the site of immunization.283,285 In contrast, intranasal (IN) immunization has been shown to induce local immunity not only in the nasalassociated lymphoid tissue and lung, but also in the female genital tract in rodents,286,287 human288 and nonhuman primates.289 Of note, it has been recently reported in the mouse that the nasal associated lymphoid tissue is also an inductive site.290 Taken together, these data make this type of immunization, which is more practical than vaginal vaccina tion, appealing to AIDS vaccine researchers. In this regard, immunization of HIV1 seronegative women with an Env subunit vaccine administered either intranasally or intravaginally, together with a mucosal adjuvant shown to be effective in mice, failed to induce detectable IgA or IgG.291 These negative results should not stop the attemps to use the IN route. In fact, various protein, DNA and RNAbased immunopotentiating adjuvants/delivery systems as well as of live bacterial and viral vectors, which may differ in their ability to induce a specific type of immune response (e.g., CTLs versus antibody responses) at the desired site,292 are available for IN immunisation and should be evaluated. However, since the nose is a wellknown port of entry for neurotropic viruses, there are safety issues that will need to be fully addressed before testing IN vaccines in clinical trials. Of note, tonsillar immunization with an attenuated SIV (SIVNef ) induced systemic im mune responses and conferred protection upon intrarectal challenge of rhesus macaques with a pathogenic SIV.293 It will be of interest to determine whether safer vaccine approaches will afford similar protection. Recent reports have suggested that combinations of mucosal and systemic im munizations may enhance both mucosal and systemic immune responses.294297
Mucosal tissues are rich in antigen presenting cells (APCs), specialised immune cells that are involved in the induction and regulation of anti-viral immunity. DCs represent the most potent APCs for nave Tlymphocytes and they are among the first cells in the body to come in contact

206

with HIV.298 These cells are critical in the early phases of infection, working as sentinels, alerting the immune system and controlling its early decisions. Furthermore, they exert a crucial role in the induction and regulation of adaptive immune responses.299 Therefore, it is critical to design vaccine formulations capable of properly targeting and stimulating DCs to induce strong immune responses at mucosal sites. It is likely that the stimuli received by DCs in the peripheral compartments affect their ability to activate Tcells and/or Bcells as well as the type of Tcell response elicited.300 Of interest, in the mouse, a single intracolorectal administration of a replication defective adenoviral vector expressing OVA or Herpes simplex virus (HSV)2 glycoprotein B antigen targeted mucosal DCs, which migrated to the draining lymph nodes and induced adaptive immune responses at the rectal and vaginal level that protected the animals against a challenge (by either route) with vaccinia expressing OVA or a lethal dose of HSV2, respectively.301 Similar protection was not afforded by IN, intravaginal, or subcute vaccination, suggesting that adenoviral vectors, which naturally target DCs, may be particularly suitable to induce protective humoral and cellular immune responses at sites that represent the major portals of entry of HIV. It remains to be seen whether these promising results are confirmed in human. In fact, intramuscular immunization with replicationdefective Ad5 vectors expressing HIV1 gag, pol, or nef failed to reduce transmission or lower viral load in high risk individuals that became infected.146 In this regard, manipulation of antigen presenting cells to elicit virusspecific cellular responses is a promising tool to control persistant viral infec tions.302309 In fact, studies in monkey310 and human311 indicate that inactivated whole viruspulsed DC vaccines may be an effective strategy for treating people with chronic HIV1 infection.
Delivery Systems
Subunit (proteins or peptides) vaccines are generally very safe, with welldefined components. However, these antigens are often poorly immunogenic and adjuvants are required to induce a measurable and supposedly adequate immunity. Thus, a vast array of delivery systems (e.g., micro/nanoparticles, emulsions, ISCOMS, liposomes, virosomes and viruslike particles), im munomodulators (cytokines, chemokines or costimulatory molecules) and, as mentioned above, even autologous DCs pulsed with viral antigens have been proposed and are presently being used to increase the efficiency of vaccines against HIV/AIDS (Table 5). Furthermore, several highly attenuated replicating and nonreplicating vectors have been or are being tested in a number of preclinical and clinical trials (ref. 240 and Table 6)
These strategies, reviewed elsewhere,240 have proven effective in controlling viremia and pro gression to AIDS in nonhuman primates, but observations in early phase clinical trials in humans have not been promising. In fact, some of the trials had to be stopped at various stages due to adverse reactions to the delivering vector312 or the inability of the expressed immunogen to cover genetically diverse isolates prevalent in the geographical areas.313 Nevertheless, the outcome of several ongoing clinical trials is expected to deliver good news about safe vaccine delivery vectors and, if possible, an effective vaccine against a particular strain of HIV19 (Table 6). Here we briefly review the different approaches utilized to deliver vaccines that are currently being evaluated in clinical trials (Table 5).
Plasmid DNA
Genetic vaccines (nakedDNA vaccines), employ DNA plasmids as "Trojan horse" vectors to deliver genes that code for HIV epitopes (for a review see ref. 314). These expression vectors remain in their episomal form into the host cell where they produce peptides that induce cellular immu nity. Compared to viral and bacterial vectors, DNA plasmids focus the immune response on more narrowly on HIV insert sequences, do not induce (and are not affected by preexisting ) immunity to the vector, are cheap and have several regulatory, safety, handling advantages.314 Immunization with DNA plasmids containing HIV inserts has been demonstrated to elicit substantial cellular response in mice and nonhuman primates,315,316 but not in humans.317
Therefore, many strategies have been undertaken to enhance the immunogenicity of genetic vaccines, which include delivery systems, modifications of the vaccine construct, formulation with immunostimulatory molecules.314 In particular promoter modification and inclusion of genes

encoding cytokines that increase the expansion of antigenspecific Tcells (IL2 and IL15), or attract and induce the maturation of APCs (GMCSF and Bchemokines) have been evaluated (for a review see refs. 318, 319). Furthermore, novel formulations are being pursued to increase the in vivo expression of DNA vaccines and to protect them from rapid degradation, involving adjuvants or carriers such as liposomes, bacterial endotoxin, macroglobulins, CpG oligodeoxinucleotides, peptides and polymers (described below).320322 Nevertheless, DNA vaccines recently tested in clinical trials displayed limited immunogenicity195,323325 and most DNA vaccines are presently delivered as a prime in heterologous primeboosts strategies (see below).
Bacterial Vectors
Among bacterial vectors, live attenuated recombinant Mycobacterium spp. and enteric bacteria such as Salmonella spp. are microorganisms that can be administered at a mucosal surface and should be able to specifically induce mucosal cellular and humoral immune responses.326 Bacterial DNA vaccine delivery demonstrated in vivo efficacy in several experimental animal models of infectious diseases.327 Attenuated strains of Salmonella spp. have been developed as potential vec tors for stimulating immune responses in the gastrointestinal mucosa.328 An advantage of these vectors is the possibility to exploit the Type III secretion system, a multicomponent system that allow delivery of antigens directly into the cytoplasm, favouring MHC class I antigenprocessing and presentation.329
A Salmonella in which the SIV gag transgene had been fused to a Type IIIsecreted bacterial protein was used in a Salmonellaprime/MVAboost regimen to stimulate SIV Gagspecific CTL responses in the gastrointestinal tract of rhesus macaques.330 Although low levels of CTLs were detected after the priming, upon MVA boosting strong CTL responses were detected in the blood and in the colonic mucosa. However, no protection against intrarectal challenge with SIVmac239 was observed.330 In a Phase I dose escalation trial oral delivery of Salmonella expressing HIV Gag resulted safe and induced strong immune responses to Salmonella antigens, but modest immune responses to Gag.331,332
Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette--Guérin (BCG) is another promising vector. BCG has a long record of safety in humans and is able to induce longlasting immunity.333 However, despite extensive testing in small animals (mice and guinea pigs), evidence in nonhuman primates of prom ising immunogenicity334,335 and efficacy against an homologous challenge after a single inoculation of rBCG expressing the HIVMNV3 loop,336 recommendations by WHO and UNAIDS to further explore the use of rBCG as a potential vectored vaccine for HIV,337 no clinical trial has started yet with this vaccine approach. While preexisting immunity to BCG does not seem to be a problem, use of this vector in developing countries where Mycobacterium tubercolosis (and tubercolosis) is highly prevalent and even BCG vaccination may be fatal in immunodeficient children,338 raise some concerns on the feasibility of large scale vaccination with this platform.
Another interesting vector is represented by Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), a facultative intracel lular bacterium that enters the cell by phagocytosis and colonizes the cytosol of the host cell.339 Several properties make Lm an attractive HIV vaccine vector. First, this bacterium is a good agent to stimulate innate as well as adaptive immune responses since it specifically infects and induces maturation of DCs. Second, foreign antigens encoded by Lm are efficiently processed and pre sented by both MHC class I and MHC class II molecules, thus activating both CD8+ and CD4+ antigenspecific Tcells.340342 Third, Listeriaderived vaccine vectors may be given orally.343 In animal models, oral or parenteral immunization with Lm engineered to express a number of HIV/SIV antigens induced strong cellmediated immune responses, but demonstrated little efficacy against a SIVmac239 challenge in macaques vaccinated against Env and Gag in DNA primerLm boost regimen.339,344,345 However, as Lm can cause serious infections in neonates, pregnant women and immunocompromised hosts, different attenuation strategies are being undertaken to overcome safety issues associated with the use of live Lm as vaccine vector in humans. In particular, a live at tenuated Lm346 and a killed but metabolically active Lm347 have been recently developed and shown preserved immunogenicity and efficacy in tumor mouse models.346349 In nonhuman primates,

vaccination with an attenuated strain termed Lmdd expressing HIV1 gag induced Gagspecific Tcell responses upon oral administration, whereas combined oral/intramuscular administration induced strong Gagspecific systemic and mucosal Ab responses. This difference was also evident for antivector Ab, indicating that the route of administration strongly influences the type of re sponse elicited. Of note, a very late boost failed to induce a robust increase of antiGag Ab titers, suggesting that antivector Ab may severely limit the vaccine immunogenicity.350 In this regard, an heterologous DNA primeoral Lm boost strategy appears a more promising approach, in that it induced in rhesus macaques mucosal SIVGagspecific CD8+ Tcells expressing the a4b7 integrin guthoming receptor.351
Viral Vectors
Safety concerns about live attenuated viruses and inactivated vaccines352,353 have led scientists to look for better and safer ways of making an AIDS vaccine. Most of the more promising AIDS vaccine candidates currently being developed and tested use viral vectors, viruses that are not harm ful and act as the delivery system to carry HIV antigens to the immune system.354 The potential advantage of the viral vector strategy is to mimic as closely as possible the efficacy of liveattenuated vaccines, while at the same time offering much greater safety. Since several of such vectors are replication competent, the emergence of viral escape mutants may represent a concern. Further, although used as vectors, these are actually viruses that have developed multiple and sophisticated ways to modulate and evade the defense system,355 which may affect the immunogenicity of the transgene, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Also, some of the proteins of the vector may be highly immunogenic, thus hampering the immunogenicity of the transgene. Thus, a better knowl edge of these aspects is critical when designing vaccination approaches based on viral vectors. A number of different viruses have been developed as vectors for vaccines. The different vectors all have their own advantages and disadvantages. Among viral vectors, poxviruses and adenoviruses have received the most attention in the design of HIV vaccine.
Poxvirus Vectors
Several poxviruses, relatives of vaccinia (the smallpox vaccine), are attractive vectors since their large genome allows for the inclusion of multiple heterologous genes, including those encoding antigens, costimulatory molecules and cytokines. Moreover, poxvirus vectors may be used for mu cosal immunization.356 Attenuated vaccinia strains such as MVA and NYVAC (derived from the Copenhagen strain by further deletion of 18 open reading frames encoding molecules implicated in pathogenicity and hostrange regulatory functions) are the most frequently used poxvirus vec tors. These vectors have been shown to be safe in immunocompromised macaques and in human Phase I/II clinical trials.357360 Preexisting immunity to vaccinia is of a limited concern since its use for smallpox vaccination has ended more than twenty years ago. Most of the recombinant HIV vaccine using poxviruses are effective in nonhuman primate models,361364 however, they have much less immunogenicity and less durable immune responses in humans.
Vaccination with rMVA alone has failed to show sufficient immunogenicity in preventive and therapeutic Phase I clinical trials365,366 and because of the inherent high immunogenicity of the vector MVA is currently used as boost for DNA vaccines (see below). However, therapeutic vaccination with MVAnef was safe and induced novel immune responses in the majority of the 14 volunteers.259,367
Other poxvirus vectors presently being tested include canarypox368 and fowlpox (for a review see ref. 369). Despite promising results in monkeys.370 Canarypox vectors expressing different HIV genes have shown limited immunogenicity in humans even at high doses, which were associated to high reactogenicity.371,372 Results from a Phase II trial recently conducted using the recombinant canarypox ALVAC vCP1452A administered alone or together with rgp120 failed to demonstrate sufficient immunogenicity to grant advancement to Phase III trials.373 Based on composite data from Phase I and Phase II trials, Aventis and the Thai Ministry of Health, together with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the US Military HIV Research Program, have launched a

Phase III trial with a HIV1 Envbased vaccine in which a canarypox prime is followed by boosting with the VaxGen gp120 protein (Table 6).
Similarly, despite promising results in the monkey model,374 a Phase I therapeutic trial with a fowlpox vector expressing Gag and Pol failed to display any immunogenicity of the transgenes, although it induced antivector Abs.375 Immunogenicity was demonstrated in a more complex thera peutic trial in which immunization with fowlpox expressing several HIV antigens was combined with HIV lipopeptides (synthetic fragments of HIV proteins associated with lipids that facilitate the induction of a cellular immune response) and followed by administration of IL2, confirming the intrinsic weak immunogenicity of this vector.376 Fowlpox vectored vaccines performed poorly also in heterologous DNA primefowlpox boost approaches both in monkeys and Phase I preven tive or therapeutic trials.375,377,378 Subsequent studies in the monkey model suggest that the poor immunogenicity observed in human as compared to monkeys might be due to the vaccine dose used, which might be insufficient to trigger adequate responses.379 However, higher production costs, multiple inoculations and reactogenicity are serious obstacles to scaling up vaccine dosing and might hamper further development of vaccines of this type.
Adeno and AdenoAssociated Vectors
Adenoviral vectors have a broad host range and infect both proliferating and quiescent cells. The tropism of adenoviruses for mucosal epithelium makes them extremely attractive as vectors for HIV vaccine development since they can been delivered orally or intranasally and induce mucosal immune responses.380 Recombinant adenovirus vectors can accommodate larger inserts, mediate transient but high levels of protein expression and can be easily produced at high titers. Furthermore, adenoviruses targets DCs in which they upregulate costimulatory molecules and MHC class II expression and induce production of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines.381,382 Of note, Adenovirusbased vaccine candidates have produced the most impressive cellular immune responses seen so far.383 Both replicationcompetent and--incompetent vectors are being developed as vaccine against HIV. However, while replicationcompetent adenovirus vectors induce stronger and more persistent humoral and cellular immune responses compared to the nonreplicating vec tors, there are safety concerns about their use in clinical trials.383385
The replicationincompetent recombinant adenovirus Type 5 (rAd5) is a modified form of Ad5, the virus that causes some forms of the common cold. It is replicationdefective to enhance safety and represents one of the most promising viral vectors for HIV vaccines. However, prior exposure to Ad5 may boost anti Ad5 antibody response blunting the expression of the transgene and the percentage of volunteers responding to the vaccine. This antivector immunity may rep resent a major problem in the developing world, where the prevalence of prior exposure to Ad5 is greatest.386 This has prompted the development by Merck, Crucell and Transgene, in collabora tion with IAVI, of candidate vaccines based on less prevalent human Adenovirus serotypes (Ad6, Ad35, Ad11, or Ad 24) to replace the Ad5 vector in fusion HIV trials.387390 Another approach to circumvent preexisting immunity to Ad5 has been to modify the vector by substituting key neutralizing epitopes on the surface of viral capsid proteins with those from the less prevalent serotype Ad48. Such chimeric vector is called Ad5HVR48.391
Finally, preexisting immunity to adenovirus may be overcome by heterologous primeboost strategies, including DNA priming followed by adenovirus vector boosting,96,392 or the use of different adenovirus serotypes, including the above mentioned Ad5HVR48, for priming and boosting.393,394
Upon extensive testing in nonhuman primates Merck found out that intramuscular vaccination with SIV Gag delivered by Ad5 (E1 deleted) was superior to DNA or MVA at inducing CTL responses and at protecting against disease following pathogenic intravenous challenged with SHIV89.6P,141,142 but not against an intrarectal challenge with SIVmac239.143 Noteworthy, the limited protection upon SIVmac239 occurred in the presence of Tcell responses that correlated with protection in the former study.144 Coimmunization with Ad5 carrying Gag and Env was less effective than Gag alone at controlling infection in rhesus macaques challenged intravenously with

218

SHIV89.6P238 confirming the detrimental role of CTL responses to Env observed in the natural infection.63 In order to increase the breadth of response against HIV1 and to improve the vac cine efficacy, replication defective Ad5 vectors carrying pol and nef were constructed and a Phase IIb trial started in 2004 in which 3,000 high risk individuals were immunized intramuscularly 3 times with replication defective Ad5 vectors expressing gag, pol and nef (Ad5MRKAd5 trivalent). This trivalent vaccine was generally safe and well tolerated at all doses studied and immunogenic eliciting responses against the 3 antigens included in the vaccine. However, preliminary data indicate that vaccination did not protect from infection or lowered viral loads. Further, there was an apparent higher susceptibility to infection in vaccinees with preexisting immunity to the vector.146,395 Reduced expression and immunogenicity of the transgenes, as suggested by the much lower proportion of vaccinees responding to all the three HIV antigens (Gag, Pol and Nef ) in the group with preexisting immunity to Ad5 as compared to vaccinees with no preexisting immunity, immune activation generated by the response to the vector and/or an increase of HIVspecific target Tcells induced by the vaccine148 are some of the hypotheses that have been proposed to explain these findings. Thus, although very preliminary, overall preclinical and clinical data may suggest that SIV is a more rigorous challenge virus and a better predictor of vaccine efficacy in human and that boosting of preexisting immunity to the vector may actually enhance the suscep tibility to infection as compared to placebo or vaccinees with no preexisting immunity. Another nonreplicative adenoviral vector (deleted of the genes coding for E1 and E3 proteins) has been developed by NIH Vaccine Research Center (VRC), together with a DNAbased vaccine. These are multicomponent vaccines, which express the Env glycoprotein from clades A, B and C and the Gag, Pol and Nef proteins from clade B and are designed for use in a DNA primeAd5 boost regimen strategy.396 Despite differences in the vaccine design, initiation of Phase II trials has been postponed to late 2008, when a better understanding of the reasons of the Merck's vaccine failure will clarify whether vaccination with the VRC candidate would pose the same risks.
Replicationcompetent adenoviral vectors have also been developed as vehicles for AIDS vac cines.397 Studies in both chimpanzee and rhesus macaque models have demonstrated that priming with replicating Ad recombinants encoding HIV or SIV genes followed by boosting with viral protein subunits elicits potent humoral, cellular and mucosal immune responses.385,398405 Of note, vaccination of Rhesus macaques with Ad vectors expressing HIV1 Tat and Env conferred a strong protection against a challenge with the pathogenic SHIV 89.6P, which was superior to that pro vided by a larger vaccine formulation including SIV Gag and Nef in addition to HIV1 Tat and Env.268 This underscores the importance of properly selecting the antigens to combine together and provides one of the strongest evidence in favor of the Tat + Env vaccine.
Other viral vectors used as AIDS vaccines in clinical trials include Adenoassociated viruses (AAV) which are not adenoviruses but are often found in adenovirus infections.406,407 These vec tors are currently used in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials.9 However, the weak immunogenicity recorded in a multicentric Phase I study408 has led to halting the initiation of Phase II trials in India and spurred a debate on the ethics of conducting the ongoing Phase II trials in Africa in the face of such disappointing Phase I results. The slightly better immunogenicity recorded at the highest dose tested in the Phase I trials may suggest that a dose increase could solve this problem. However, recent data indicate that, in mice, vaccination with high doses of AAV expressing Gag induced Gagspecific effector CD8+ CTLs that were weak producers of IFNg, expressed exhaustion markers and failed to become memory cells. Transition to the memory phenotype and restoration of full functionality was achieved upon adoptive transfer, suggesting that chronic exposure to the trangene might have been the cause of the CTL dysfunction.409
Other Viral Vectors
Other viral vectors have been tested as vaccine vectors for HIV1 and have shown various degrees of success (for a review see ref. 410). Among them, the alphaviruses include weakened forms of three viruses named Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE), Sindbis (SIN) and Semliki Forest Virus (SFV). The first alphavirus vector candidate, AlphaVax's VEE, is designed as a replicon

219

particles containing selfreplicating RNA encoding the VEE replicase proteins and expressing a gene of interest in place of the viral structural protein genes. An appealing feature of alphaviruses is their known ability to induce apoptosis of transduced cells, favouring DC crosspriming.411 These replicon particles have shown protection against other viruses and have elicited significant cellmediated and antibody immune responses with SIV antigens, perhaps due to the propensity of the vector to target antigenpresenting cells.412 The VEE vector is currently being tested in clinical trials.413
Viruses belonging to the rhabdovirus family and in particular the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) are also being used. These vectors offer the advantage to be highly flexible, easy to ma nipulate and able to express large and multiple foreign genes.414 Intramuscular vaccination of mice with a singlecycle vector expressing HIV Env elicited strong Envspecific humoral and cellular responses.415 Furthermore, immunization of macaques with recombinant VSVs (rVSVs) express ing SIV Gag and HIV Env has been reported to protect from pathogenic SHIV89.6P.416,417 These promising results have led to the development of rVSV for use in humans.418 However, since the prototypic rVSV vector was found to be insufficiently attenuated for clinical evaluation, novel highly attenuated vectors have been designed, which are less neurovirulent and more immunogenic than the prototypic rVSV vector.419
Other potentially powerful vaccine delivery systems are represented by Polioviruses.420 Both replicationcompetent and replicationdeficient recombinants have been shown to be immu nogenic in nonhuman primates when used through various routes of immunization, including mucosal delivery.421 However, restrictions to the use of these vectors include the stability and size of heterologous gene inserts422 and the presence of high levels of preexisting immunity to polio vectors in the general population.
Replicationcompetent and replicationdefective herpesviruses (HSVs), including HSV1, represent suitable vaccine vectors against AIDS. Important advantages include broad host cell range, high infectivity and easy of production of hightiter stocks of viruses, longterm expression of foreign antigens and stimulation of both humoral and cellular arms of the immune system. Vaccination with replicationcompetent or replicationdefective HSVs vaccine vectors express ing SIV Env and Nef, protected macaques against a challenge with SIVmac239.423 However, the overall toxicity and the preexisting immunity against the vector may represent a safety issue for their use in humans and current strategies focus on the development of replicationincompetent viruses used in primeboost regimen with DNA.424
New Particulate Delivery Systems
Microparticles have been effectively used for many years as particulate delivery systems for drugs, therapeutic proteins and various types of vaccines including recombinant proteins, plasmid DNA, peptides and other vaccine components (e.g., immune potentiators).425,426 Among antigenloaded microspheres, injectable, biodegradable polymeric particles prepared with poly(d,llactidecogly colide) (PLG) or poly(d,llactide) (PL) polymers represent a successful method for in vivo delivery of peptide, protein or DNA antigens.427 Both particles have been shown to be effective, especially for oral delivery.428 Antigen instability and manufacturing difficulties have been overcome by the recent findings that adsorption rather than microencapsulation of the antigen onto PLGA is easier, cheaper and ensures better antigen stability.429 In comparison to standard aluminumbased adjuvants, these microspheres have many desirable features, including the ability to enhance the bioavalaibility of the antigen, allowing pulsating antigen release and to reduce the number of doses in the immunization schedule, mimicking the conventional primeboost regimen. Furthermore, for adjuvanting vaccines against intracellular pathogens and cancer, selective targeting of PLGA microparticles to DCs has been achieved and induction of CTLs has been attained in both small animals and nonhuman primates.430 In particular PLGs have been demonstrated to enhance the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines to HIVGag and HIVEnv in rhesus macaques.431 PLG particles are currently being evaluated in a gag + env DNA/PLG primeV2 Env protein boost preventive Phase I trial.189

Two novel classes of biocompatible coreshell anionic microspheres have been used as an ef ficient delivery system for vaccination with the Tat protein.432 These microspheres, synthesized by dispersion polymerization, are characterized by an increased shelflife and the capability of reversibly adsorbing native proteins at their surface. In particular, these microparticles consist of negatively charged microspheres, made of either poly(styrene) or poly(methyl methacrylate) and in which hemisuccinated poly(vinyl alcohol) or Eudragit L100/55 were used, respectively, as steric stabiliz ers.432 These microspheres prevented Tat from oxidation, maintaining the native and biologically active conformation required for vaccine efficacy and efficiently delivered Tat intracellularly. In the mouse model, delivery of Tat by these microspheres was safe and immunogenic.433,434
VLPs
Viruslike particles (VLPs) are selfassembling, nonreplicating, nonpathogenic particles that are similar in size and conformation to intact virions.435,436 VLPs offer a number of advantages over conventional protein immunogens and have been therefore considered as an ideal HIV vaccine candidate.437 In fact, these particles can be easily produced in large amount in heterologous expres sion systems (baculovirus, vaccinia virus) and easily purified. In addition, since VLPs lack regulatory proteins as well as infectious genetic material, they are both replication and infectionincompetent, making VLPs safer than liveattenuated viruses. Further, VLPs express viral proteins in their native conformation and generally induce more effective humoral and cellular immune response than their soluble counterparts, in both the systemic and mucosal immune compartments.437439
However, due to their nonreplicating properties, VLPs are less effective at inducing cellular im mune responses as compared to liveattenuated viruses or replicating viral vector vaccines. For this reason, novel approaches are being developed in order to increase their immunogenicity, including DC targeting.440 The mucosal administration of VLP vaccines has also emerged as a promising strategy to elicit mucosal and systemic antiHIV humoral and cellular immune responses.441
To date, numerous types of VLPs have been produced utilising the ability of capsid and enve lope proteins to selfassemble into highly organised particulate structures. In particular, the Gag protein is required for their assembly, budding and release from host cell. VLPs, based on HIV1 p55gag, presenting the entire gp120 molecule from an Ugandan clade A HIV1 isolate, have been shown to induce strong systemic and mucosal humoral and cellular immune responses in mice.442,443 More recently, IN administration in a mouse model of these VLPs together with the Eurocine L3 mucosal adjuvant (a monoglycerides/fatty acid lipid suspensions)444 in a heterologous (DNA + VLPs) primeboost strategy induced higher titers of NAbs and stronger antiEnv Tcell responses as compared to vaccination with adjuvanted VLPs only.445 Further, a combined multiepitope VLPbased HIV vaccine (Combi HIVvac) carrying both B and Tcell epitopes (from HIV1 Env, Gag, Pol and Nef proteins) resulted safe and highly immunogenic in mice.446 Of interest, vac cination of rhesus macaques with p55gag VLPs in the absence of adjuvant induced broad, durable antiGag CTLs.447 However, therapeutic vaccination with HIV1 p17/p24:Ty viruslike particles, which contain part of the HIV1IIIB Gag sequence and are produced by expressing a TYA:p17/p24 fusion gene in yeast448 did not appear to slower HIV1 disease progression,449 or to impact CD4+ Tcell decline in patients with advanced HIV infection.450
Prime Boost Strategies
Many of the vaccine studies combine various approaches in a primeboost fashion to optimize the immune responses elicited. A heterologous prime boost strategy is the administration of one type of vaccine (the primer is usually DNA) followed by the administration of another form of the vaccine (the booster is usually recombinant proteins or attenuated viral vectors). The goal of this approach is to complement the priming by a different stimulation of the immune system to enhance the body's overall immune response to HIV, a result that may not be achieved with a single type of vaccine. For example, while DNA or microparticles are optimal for inducing Tcell responses, they are poor inducers of Ab, which, however, are readily induced upon boosting with protein or a recombinant vector. Another advantage of this strategy is that it circumvents the

relatively common and detrimental immunodominance of the vector that may result in a reduced immunogenicity of the transgene and the impossibility to use the same vector twice because im munity to the vector strongly reduces or prevents the transgene expression. To overcome this latter problem sequential immunizations with different viral vectors have been used as an alternative primeboost approach, as reported in nonhuman primate models against SHIV451 and SIV143,144 challenges. DNA primeviral vector boost approaches may also be exploited to target mucosal site either because of the intrinsic tropism of the vector or because they can be applied mucosally. A variety of protocols using alternative viral vectors for both priming and boosting have also been reported, both alone and in combination with DNA and have been successful at limiting disease progression, but not at offering protection against infection. For example, DNA priming followed by a recombinant MVA expressing multiple HIV proteins did not prevent but effectively controlled infection upon challenge with pathogenic SHIV89.6P in rhesus macaques.361,452 Based on the promising results in monkeys, GEOVAX is currently testing in 4 different Phase I trials a DNA primeMVA boost approach in which priming with DNA encoding Tat, Rev, Vpu and Gag is fol lowed by boosting with MVA expressing Env, Gag, Protease and RT. Preliminary data indicate good safety and CTL responses in over 50% of the vaccinees453 and a Phase II trial is planned for 2008. Similarly, McMichael and coworkers at the Oxford University have shown in Phase I studies that DNA primeMVA boost HIV vaccines are welltolerated and immunogenic, but the percentage of volunteers responding to the vector and the durability of CD8+ cellmediated responses have not matched so far the responses observed with the rAd5 vector.132,366,454 However, the lack of solid correlates of protection and the large body of evidence showing that natural control of infection is not necessarily associated with strong immune responses should not impede advancement of these type of vaccines to Phase II trials.
International Networking to Ease and Accelerate HIV/AIDS Vaccine
Development
The first Phase I trial of an HIV vaccine was conducted in the USA in 1987. Since then, more than 50 candidate vaccines have been tested in about 100 Phase I/II clinical trials, involving more than 35,000 healthy human volunteers. Two Phase III trials have been completed and a third one is in progress. The vast majority of these vaccine candidates, including those tested in Phase III trials, were based on structural HIV1 proteins and primarily aimed at inducing NAbs. Most of the efforts to develop and evaluate HIV vaccines is borne by the NIH, CDC and WRAIR in the USA and by ANRS in France, with strong help from the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) in New York (http://www.iavi.org), the European Union (EU), initiatives in WHO (http://www.who.int/en) and UNAIDS (http://www.unaids.it) and the recent commitment of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for a Global Enterprise (http://www.gatesfoundation. org/GlobalHealth/Pri_Diseases/HIVAIDS).
The HIV Vaccine Trial Network (HVTN) established by NIAID in 2000, with 25 clinical sites in four continents, represents a major resource for clinical HIV vaccine research (http://www3. niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/daids). The EU has also established a comprehensive program aimed at strengthening integration of science among countries of the EU and promoting, among the others, vaccine development against poverty diseases (i.e., HIV/AIDS, TB, Malaria). The AIDS Vaccine Integrated Project (AVIP) (http://www.avipeu.org), Mucosal Vaccines for Poverty Related Diseases (MUVAPRED) (http://www.mucosalimmunity.org/muvapred/index.asp) and the European Vaccine effort against HIV/AIDS (EUROVAC) (http://www.eurovac.net), are among the most important projects recently cofunded by the EU. In addition, the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) has been created with the aim of helping developing countries to build up their capacity in testing the efficacy of new drugs, microbicides and vaccines.

Conclusion
Several advancements have been made over the past few years to improve vaccine strategies aimed at inducing protection against HIV. Ideally, the aim of an effective vaccine would be to produce sterilizing immunity in all recipients. However, also a vaccine able to control rather than prevent the infection might have important benefits, reducing HIV levels in the body, delaying progression to AIDS and initiation of antiretroviral therapy and reducing the chance of HIV transmission.
The current knowledge suggests that an effective HIV candidate should induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, to ensure durable immunological memory and to boost both the adaptative and innate immune system. The latter one is particularly important at mucosal sites of HIV transmission.455 One of the major impediments to the development of an HIV1 vaccine is the lack of knowledge of the immune correlates of protection. Although studies of MEU and LTNPs continue to provide valuable information on mechanisms of natural protection, which can then be applied to vaccine design, it should be kept in mind that immune responses in LTNPs may represent a correlate of preservation of immune competence in a host containing infection rather than the actual factors controlling the virus. Natural resistance to infection has been attributed to a combination of genetic, innate and acquired immune systemmediated mechanisms.20 Therefore, a novel approach for treatment and/or prevention of HIV infection might be represented by the manipulation of these restriction factors in order to improve and broaden their activities.456 The early containment of HIV1 and SIV replication in acutely infected individuals and monkeys is temporally associated with the emergence of a virusspecific CTL response and high levels of circulating CTLs are associated with good clinical status in chronically infected individuals457,458 and acutely infected monkeys.459 Importantly, experimental in vivo depletion of CD8+ Tcells in monkeys, abrogated control of SIV replication during primary infection and the animals died after a rapidly progressive disease course.460462 While this has generally been interpreted as the defini tive proof of the key role of CD8+ Tcells in the containment of infection, it should be reminded that also NK cells express the CD8 molecule and their experimental depletion may contribute to the loss of virus control.
Interestingly, loss of control of infection has been reported also upon Bcell depletion during primary SIVmac infection of rhesus monkeys,460,463,464 suggesting that either Abs are indeed crucial for containing the virus even at the very beginning of the infection or, more in general, that severe disturbance of a component of the immune system disrupts the proper function of system as a whole, underscoring the integrated nature of the defense system360,463,465469 and the contribution of multiple arms to an effective control of infection (for a review see ref. 470).
Because of safety concerns, traditional immunization approaches, including those based on live attenuated and inactivated viruses, have been almost abandoned. Vaccine candidates based on purified or synthetic proteins are mainly developed to induce NAbs, whereas recent advances in mo lecular biology and genetic engineering have led to the development of a new generation of vaccines, which includes DNA and microorganismvectored vaccines, which are primarily aimed at inducing Tcell responses. In this regard, vaccinia viruses, canarypox constructs, replicationcompetent and replicationdefective adenovirus vectors are the main live vectors currently being evaluated. The success of these vectors is believed to depend also on their capability to trigger innate immune responses, which would induce proper adaptive immunity. Although replicationcompetent adenoviruses have the advantage of persistently infecting the host and stimulating the immune system,383 safety issues need to be fully addressed before their advancement to clinical trials. The recent failure of the Merck trial clearly indicates that even replicationdefective adenoviral vec tors may be harmful in the presence of preexisting immunity to the vector. Thus, DNA vaccines with increased immunogenicity and microbial vectors that circumvent preexisting immunity to the vector are needed. In this regard, optimization and further exploration of new adjuvants for DNA and protein antigens are currently being heavily pursued.471 VLPs have also been employed as multiepitope vaccine since they offer the advantages of (i) mimicking the virion without having the safety concerns of liveattenuated viruses, (ii) inducing both mucosal and systemic immune

responses, (iii) activating both endogenous and exogenous antigen presentation pathways (MHC class I and II, respectively) and (iv) maintaining the antigens in their native conformation.
Effective vaccination may ultimately require two or more vaccines used in conjunction (het erologous primeboost strategies), an approach to vaccine development that differs from tradi tional vaccine design and is presently the preferred strategy for many vaccine candidates against HIV/AIDS (Table 6). In this regard, there is a general agreement that when exploited combined, the vaccine components used for the prime and the boost are expected to stimulate a broader and more diversified immune response than using any of them repeatedly. In addition, the single use of a viral or bacterial vector will avoid the interference, on a second administration, of preexisting immunity to the vector.
Effective antiHIV/AIDS vaccines may require targeting of several HIV1 antigens. Among these multicomponent vaccines novel minimalistic vaccination strategies, combining structural (V2Env) and nonstructural (Tat or Nef ) proteins have been rationally designed to induce NAbs and Tcell responses against key early and late HIV antigens. In particular, preclinical testing of the Tat/V2Env combination in macaques has shown efficacy (ref. 268 and Ensoli B, in preparation) and clinical trials with this vaccine candidate will start in 2008.
However, HIV vaccine development still faces significant challenges. The availability of an ef fective HIV vaccine requires scientific and publichealth efforts and the establishment of Consortia such as the "European Consortia for HIV vaccine development" (including AVIP, MUVAPRED, VIAV), the "Neutralizing Antibody Consortium"; the "HIV Global Enterprise", an international Consortium of nongovernamental and governamental organizations.472 Clinical trials must also be performed with appropriate ethical rules, especially in developing countries, avoiding duplication of efforts, using standardized genetic inserts as immunogens and implementing immunological assays for preclinical and clinical testing to compare candidate vaccines. This is important because the laboratory assays used to assess immune responses may not be comparable, severely hampering decisions about which candidates to pursue for further testing. In addition, new knowledge about the immune response to HIV is raising concerns that current assays overlook important aspects of those immune responses.
Open questions remain to be answered, such as how to induce high titers of NAbs; whether any of the vaccines being currently developed will elicit cellular immune responses that will cor relate with protection from infection or disease progression; the type (poly or monofunctional) of CD4+ and CD8+ Tcell responses elicited by the vaccines currently being developed; the mag nitude, breath and durability of the vaccineinduced CD4+ and CD8+ Tcell responses; the best combination of vaccines that in the primeboost immunization strategies will stimulate an immune response similar to that thought to confer protection from disease progression.
The challenges the scientific community still faces are formidable. However, looking back, enormous progresses have been made in each aspect of vaccine development, from basic science to clinical testing, that let us be optimistic about the eventual generation of effective preventive and therapeutic vaccines against HIV/AIDS. While vaccines able to slow disease progression and decrease transmission rate should be at reach in the medium term, recent advancements in the generation of Envbased immunogens, their association to key regulatory or accessory HIV1 proteins and present reconsideration of the several Ab effector functions, make us hoping that even a sterilizing vaccine may be not too far distant.
